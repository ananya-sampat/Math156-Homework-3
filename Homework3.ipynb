    "Summary: \n",
    "The logistic regression model demonstrated strong classification performance on the test set, achieving an accuracy of 91.23%, indicating overall reliability. With a precision of 90.67%, the model correctly identified malignant cases most of the time, though it occasionally misclassified benign cases as malignant (false positives). The recall of 95.77% shows that the model is highly sensitive, successfully detecting the majority of actual malignant cases, which is crucial in medical diagnosis. The F1-score of 93.15% confirms a well-balanced trade-off between precision and recall. While the model performs well, its slightly lower precision suggests that it could be improved by adjusting the decision threshold, applying regularization, or fine-tuning hyperparameters to reduce false positives. Additionally, the overflow encountered by the sigmoid function should be fixed by limiting z or using a numerically stable sigmoid. "
